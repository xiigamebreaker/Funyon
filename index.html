                5 year old Noah Lott found his stepfather, Ben Over, CEO of Next Dream Tech, fast asleep at his home
                office desk in the middle of the workday. In an hour and a half, he developed an app worth 1.4 million
                dollars! Thanks to Noah Lott, the world's youngest self-made millionaire, there have been thousands of
                happy customers. In an interview, his mother, Lee Ning Over, stated that she knew her son was bright,
                but had no idea he was this level of genius!

            <p>
                In his first week as a firefighter, 21-year-old Julian 'Frankenstein' Gerrity was chased up a tree by a
                stray dog. Luckily, Scuba Steve, the neighborhood cat, came to the rescue and chased the dog away so
                that Frankenstein could safely come down from the tree and resume his shift at the fire station. Scuba
                Steve is now an honorary firefighter friend with his own perch in the firehouse, where he can keep a
                bird's-eye watch over the neighborhood.
